# Task: Choose and set up a team password manager

**Description:**

A password manager can help organize and manage secrets such as passwords in a
safe way, and share them between members of a team when there is a reason to do
so.

Whenever possible it is good practice to use separate, named accounts for each
member of a team so that the origin of actions can be
identified. However, sometimes we will still end up with secrets that
we need to share throughout the team.

Having a team password manager in place will mean that we never have
to resort to emails, instant messages, sticky notes, or knowledge
bases for sharing secrets.

**Evaluation Questions**

Here are five key questions you can ask when choosing a team password manager:

* Are any password managers already in use within the organization?
* Do we want to have commercial support if something goes wrong?
* Is there a need to have an easy-to-use graphical interface?
* Do we need Active Directory / SAML / SSO integration?
* Is it permissible to use a cloud based service?

You may also find it useful to consider:

* Do we need two factor authentication in the password manager itself?
* Does it support auditing?
* Are a lot of people on the team already using a tool?
* Is using open source allowed or desired?
* Do we want breach notifications?
* Can people continue to use it as a tool for their own personal needs after they’ve left the project?
